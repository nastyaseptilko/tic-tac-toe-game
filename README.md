# Tic-tac-toe game
Many people probably know this simple game. The game takes place through the console.
To make a move, you need to enter the coordinates of an empty cell into the console, for example: 0x1y.

## Rules for tic-tac-toe
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 by 3.

2. You choose which sign you have (the standard is X or O, but in this game, you can choose any other symbol). Players take turns placing their marks in the empty squares. You go first, then the computer.

3. The first player to receive 3 of its marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) is the winner.
